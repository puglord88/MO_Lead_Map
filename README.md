The purpose of this was to create a dashboard that will display CDC data from 2012-2017 on a leaflet map to indicate the blood lead level of children in each Missouri county. 

Data was also obtained from the Missouri government database via API and displayed on a leaflet map of where active lead mines are located in Missouri and which counties have displayed poor air lead quality. 
This is used as a cross reference to whether children in counties where higher levels of lead contaminants are present may have higher cases of lead poisoning along with increased blood lead level concentrations. 

Lead data from all the states are obtained from the CDC and used as a comparison to Missouri. An interactive dashboard is created to display Missouri's blood lead level states to nine other states with the highest blood lead level counts.
